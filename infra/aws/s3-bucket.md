S3 (Bucket) is a scalable object storage service provided by AWS. It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. S3 is designed for durability, availability, and scalability.

### Terminology

- **Bucket**: A container for storing objects in S3. Each bucket has a unique name across all AWS accounts (all regions).
- **Object**: The fundamental entity stored in S3, consisting of data and metadata. Each object is identified by a unique key within a bucket. You can store millions of objects in a bucket.
- **Key**: The unique identifier for an object within a bucket. It can be thought of as the object's name.
- **Region**: The geographical location where the bucket is stored. Buckets are region-specific, and you can choose the region when creating a bucket.
